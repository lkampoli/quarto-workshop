# Quarto {background-color="#2780e3"}

A brief overview to Quarto

<!--[(that's why we are here, right?)]{.smaller}-->

## Preamble

-   Agreement on importance of Literate programming[^1] <!--(concept) and notebooks (artifacts) -->
-   Lots of different solutions, mostly language specific

[^1]: Literate programming is a methodology that combines a programming language
with a documentation language, thereby making programs more robust, more portable, 
more easily maintained, and arguably more fun to write than programs that are 
written only in a high-level language ([Knuth, 1984](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html)).

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R: Rmarkdown

-   Markdown with configurable code blocks
-   Focus on R (but does support other languages [see here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html))
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   natively, bookdown, blogdown, ...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Python: Jupyter notebook

-   Single `JSON` file containing code, text and output
-   Kernels for many programming languages
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   Jupyter book, nbconvert, ...
:::
:::

<!-- This might be about to change with Quarto -->

::: notes
But before actually speaking about Quarto, I wanted to highlight two items.

First, the shared agreement in the community about the importance of literate programming ...

And second, that the way this has been approached greatly differs based on the programming language you may be using.

## What's Quarto?

According to their creators[^2] ([Posit](https://posit.co/) - formerly RStudio)):

[^2]: Development started in January 2021 and is under heavy development (weekly releases)

-   "Open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc" - [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)
-   "Code output via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable" - [GitHub Repo](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/)

. . .

From a technical standpoint (Adapted from [Mock, 2022](https://jthomasmock.github.io/quarto-2hr-webinar/materials/01-intro-quarto.html#/so-what-is-quarto)):

> Quarto is a **command line interface** (CLI) [that **renders** mixed-format files (`.ipynb`/Jupyter notebook) OR plain text files (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`)]{.fragment} [into different **outputs** (reports, books, websites, presentations...)]{.fragment} [, which can be in different **formats** (PDF/Word/HTML...) .]{.fragment}

::: notes
So, what's Quarto, then?

According to Posit (formerly known as Rstudio), the creators of Quarto, Quarto is the next generation of Rmarkdown...

Ok, this is how Quarto is marketed, but this may not be clear to most of us, so we tried to define it from a more technical point of view.

Adapting from Mock, Quarto is...

<!-- Does this look familiar to you? -->

::: notes
We've seen what Quarto is, so now let's focus on how it does its thing.

At this point, if there's someone who has used Rmd before may be thinking. 
But Lorenzo, you've just defined how rmd works!

And aside from minor changes in the frontmatter, that's true

So probably the next slide will bring some light on the differences

## How does it work?

This is what happens behind the scenes for single file documents:

Not comprehensive (i.e. does not include projects, bibliographical references and cross-references tables, figures, chapters, add custom css, including files within files ...)
